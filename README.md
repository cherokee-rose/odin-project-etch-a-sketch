# odin-project-etch-a-sketch
My solution to the Odin Project Etch-a-Sketch challenge.

How it works:
    When user opens up the page, our script generates the 960x960 pixels grid filled with the 16x16 squared divs. The squares represent the drawing pixels which can be hovered, doing so changes the color of the squares(pixels) and so it creates the effect of drawing. There is also the 'Reset' button, which when clicked clear the current grid and promts the user to enter a number of squares per side no more than 100 for the next grid.
